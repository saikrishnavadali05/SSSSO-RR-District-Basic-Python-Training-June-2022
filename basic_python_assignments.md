### Assignments (SET - 1)


1. Write a program to print each word of the line in a new line using both while and for loops. 
```console
Input : Love All Serve All Help Ever Hurt Never

Output : 
Love
All
Serve 
All 
Help
Ever
Hurt
Never
```

2. Write a program to find the maximum, minimum, average, addition, multiplication of any 2 integer numbers (for example : 23 and 34)

3. Write a program to print all the elements within a list in the reverse order. The entire list has to be passed via command line arguments (Hint : use ```argv```)

4. Write a program to print all the alternative elements of a tuple. The  elements to the tuple have to be given to the program using `input()` function.

5. Write a program to print all the details of a student by storing all of his details in a dictionary by retrieveing the values from keys. Next, Print the entire dictionary. Next, print each and every key value pair seperately. Next, print only values (Don't print keys).

6. Write a program to pass a list as a command line arguments. Next, convert that list into a tuple after removing all the duplicate elements. (hint : use `set`) Next, add all the elements of that duplicate free tuple and print the addition output.

7. Write a program to print this pattern (hint : use `\t` and `\n` wherever required).

```console
         *
     * python *
   * is  *  a    *
 * good  * programming * language *
* to * learn * for * beginners *
```

8. Write a program to create variables storing values for each datatype. print the object identities of all the created variables. Next, convert the types of the each varible into another type. After changing the type, store all the values of all the variables in a list. Finally, Print the list.

9. Write a program that imports numpy, matplotlib, pandas libraries. If the program imports those modules successfully. print "modules imported successfully" (*hint : research about these libraries in google. Find out the command of how to install those libraries. Understand the purpose and importance of these libraries*). 

10. What is zen of python? Write a program to illustrate "zen of python"? (Hint : Search on google.)

> Very IMPORTANT! Please search in google whenever you are stuck. Even if you get an error (traceback). Search about that traceback on google. For every difficulty or uncertainity, don't forget to search on google.

##### Steps to submit:
1. Create a folder with name : submissionnumber_fullname_contributions 
2. include all of your programs in that folder. Each program for each question.
3. then drag and drop the entire folder to your cloned repo 
4. then raise a pull request.


### Assignments (SET-2)

1) Write a program to print the add, subtract, divide, multiply,  of the digits using functions. Add, subtract, divide, multiply functions should be created. For example, if the input is 235, the result should be 10. Next, Load the input number 235 from a text file `input.txt`. Next, Save the program output into a text file `output.txt`. 
2) Given a Full name stored in a input file `input_name.txt` which contains first name, middle name and last name. All the first, middle and last name are seperated by spaces. Print the output in the following order: Last Name, First Name, middle name. Next, Save the last name in `last_name.txt` file. Save the first name in `first_name.txt. Save the middle name in `middle_name.txt` file.
3) Write a program that accepts a positive integer `n`. Next, write a function to find factorial of the number. and next, write another function to compute the value of `n+nn+nnn`. If n is 5, first output should be 5! = 120 and the next output should be 5+55+555 = 615.
4) Write a program to load, open and save an image. (hint : use opencv-python or PIL modules. Research about them on google and youtube)
5) Given a list of numbers write a program to calculate the sum of odd and even numbers and print the same. Accept from the user the count of numbers and the actual 
numbers.
6) Find out what is a timestamp? Print date and time in a timestamp. Print the seconds, hours, minutes as sepearate integer numbers from that timestamp. (hint : use `datetime` module. Search on google when stuck). 
7) Given a string print all the lowercase characters, upper case characters and numeric  characters and their counts.
8) Write a program to check if the input string is a palindrome? Next, Make the program to work on integers as well. Write a palindrome function. Call that function of 5 different inputs to test whether the function is written properly or not.
9) Store student name, id, age, class, course in a dictionary. Write a script to lookup a student name, age, class, course given the student ids.
10) Write a script to print all the rows of a csv file. (hint : use `pandas` library).
11) What is a json file? Write a script to load and print a json file. (hint : use `json` library)
12) Write a script to get the maximum and minimum value in a csv column containing 10 numbers. (hint : use `pandas` or `csv` libraries).
13) Write a function that accepts a sentence from a paragraph stored in a text file `input.txt` and calculates the number of letters and digits within that sentence string.
14) Write a function add which takes variable parameters and it returns the sum of all arguments which are integers.
15) Write a function mathOp() such that it can accept two variables and calculate the  addition, multiplication and subtraction of it. The result must be returned a single return call.
16) Create a function showStudent() which has student id, student name and marks as input. It should display all the data. If marks is missing it should display 75.
17) Write a script to read first n lines of a file. Accept filename and n as input from the user. Similar to Unix head command.
18) Write a script to read last n lines of a file. Accept filename and n as input from the user. Similar to Unix tail command.
19) Write a program to count the number of words in an input file. Accept filename as input from the user.
20) Write a script that accepts a comma separated list of words and prints a hypen separated list of words in sorted ordered :
> Input: b,c,a,d,a,e,b,f
> Output: a_a_b_b_c_d_e_f


> Top 10 contributors will be rewarded.
