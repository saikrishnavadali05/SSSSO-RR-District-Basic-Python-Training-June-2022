The Dowry system is evil in society. 
It has reduced the sacred affair of marriage to a business deal. 
Brides are treated as a marketable commodity.
The parents of the brides are often put under inhuman pressure for a 
handsome dowry. Sometimes they become paupers to get their 
daughters married. In many cases, young brides are ruthlessly tortured or pushed to 
suicide.

To eradicate this social evil, a total change in the outlook of society is a must. 
The woman has to be considered as an equal partner to the man. 
Widespread education and employment and their rights of property 
can bring about the right remedy. Legal prohibition of dowry is not 
enough. Strong social disapproval of dowry is the only 
guarantee against this evil. Our youth should come forward 
to generate public awareness against this shameful custom.
