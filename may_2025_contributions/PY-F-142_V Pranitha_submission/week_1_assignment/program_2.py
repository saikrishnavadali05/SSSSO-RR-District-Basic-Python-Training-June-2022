'''question 2
Ask the user for two whole numbers and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.'''
#solution

a=int(input("enter first number"))# take input as a from the user of first number
b=int(input("enter second number"))#take input as b from the user of second number
sum=a+b #use operator + for getting sum value
diff=a-b#use operator - for getting diff values
product=a*b#use operator* for getting product value
quo=a/b#use operator / for getting quo value
print(sum)# print sum
print(diff)#print diff
print(product)#print product
print(quo)#print quo
